I am currently a PhD candidate on Neural Machine Translation at the
[Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC)](http://www.upc.edu/?set_language=en) in Barcelona.
I am conducting my thesis under the supervision of Professors
[Marta Ruiz Costa-Jussa](http://www.costa-jussa.com/) and
José Adrian Rodríguez Fonollosa, in the [Language and Speech Technologies
and Applications (TALP) research group](http://www.talp.upc.edu/).
I teach Matlab and also do TA for Deep Learning subjects.


I have been software developer for most of my life, then data scientist
and now I have turned back to University to take on my _long-cherished_
dream to become a researcher on machine learning and artificial intelligence.


I have special interes in Deep Learning, and specifically in Neural Machine Translation.
I constantly scan the field to identify innovations and track the evolution of
the state of the art. Lately I am focused on
the Transformer architecture [recently proposed](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)
by Google folks.
